<h2>Shipping</h2>

<h3>When will I get my first box?</h3>
<p>The first shipment in beta will arrive January 2, 2013. After that we ship our monthly boxes on the 1st and 15th of each month via USPS. Also be on the lookout for our free “aid station” shipment late in the month.</p>

<h3>Is shipping free? What’s the policy.</h3>
<p>Yes for the USA! Although shipping to Canada will incur a $5 shipping charge per month.</p>

<h3>Where does TriplePulse ship to?</h3>
<p>We currently ship everywhere in the United States and Canada!</p>

<h3>Will I be able to track my shipment?</h3>
<p>If you're in the US, each month we'll send you a tracking link in your email once we've shipped your pack.</p>

<h3>What if I want to change my address?</h3>
<p>Head on over to your account page to change your address and any other information that needs updating - by the 5th of each month. (Otherwise your TriplePulse will go to your old address.) If you have problems changing your address, feel free to email us with your name and the new address where you'd like your TriplePulse shipped.</p>

<h3>Help! My pack never came. What do I do?</h3>
<p>We are so sorry about that -- text the CEO at 424-256-9133 or just send an email to <a href="mailto:info@triplepulse.com">support@TriplePulse.com</a> and we’ll get everything sorted out for you.</p>

<h2>Billing</h2>
<h3>Why do you guys charge the total cost of the subscription up front?</h3>
<p>Good question! The reason that we can offer such good prices on our longer subscriptions is because we charge up front. That way you can apply the savings to race registration or much needed equipment.</p>

<h3>When will I be billed?</h3>
<p>When you place your order for the monthly membership, you will be billed for your first TriplePulse pack immediately. For orders placed between the 1st and 15th, you will be billed on the first day of each month after your first shipment. For orders placed between the 16th and 31st, you will be billed on the 15th of each following month.</p>

<h3>Can I gift a TriplePulse subscription?</h3>
<p>Of course you can! You can gift to anyone you’d like! All we need is your payment information, their email address to get started. Once we have all those details, we’ll shoot your recipient an email letting them know what a great friend you are and prompt them to sign up using their unique gift code.</p>

<h3>Are there any hidden fees?</h3>

<p>No, it's only your monthly subscription fee. Although if you’re from Canada, there is an extra $5/month shipping fee to get those packs delivered in The Great White North.</p>

<h2>More Questions</h2>

<h3>Are the supplements in my TriplePulse pack safe to use?</h3>
<p>We source our products from well-established manufacturers. However, much of the label information has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. It is always best to consult your doctor before taking any supplements or minerals.</p>

<h3>Do you have a referral program?</h3>
<p>Yes we do! To find your customized TriplePulse referral link, login to your account and click on the “Invite” tab. Copy the link in the box on the right side of the page and share away! For every new subscriber that you refer to TriplePulse, you’ll receive one extra month of TriplePulse for free. Nifty, eh?</p>

<h3>I want to talk to a person there, can I call you?</h3>

<p>Yes! Text our CEO at 424-256-9133 or email us at <a href="mailto:info@triplepulse.com">info@triplepulse.com</a>. We're available Monday through Friday from 9 am to 6 pm PST.</p>

<h3>Will you tell me what is coming in my “aid station” ahead of time? Can I choose?</h3>

<p>No, this part is designed as a surprise--its meant to be just like that aid station late in a race that gets you through to the finish line. We plan to customize what you receive the more we learn about your goals, races, etc.</p>

<h3>What's your cancellation policy?</h3>

<p>You can cancel your subscription via the account page at any time. You will still receive the packs you have already paid for but your subscription will not be renewed the next time billing is set to occur. If you subscribed to one of our discounted multi-month packages and cancel before the duration of your subscription, you will be refunded for the packs you have yet to receive, less the discount that was applied.</p>

<h3>What payment options do I have?</h3>

<p>We accept most major credit cards or through paypal. </p>

<h3>Can I return my TriplePule pack?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, no. If you received your pack, we’re legally not able to accept returns due to liability reasons.  But try to ask a friend or post it to craigslist. Don’t let the goods go to waste!</p>

<h3>Can I “skip” a month?</h3>
<p>You can cancel and then sign back up, but our products work best with continual usage.</p>

<h3>Can I buy multiple boxes for a single month?</h3>
<p>Sure thing! But if you’re buying it for a friend or family member you’ll want to take advantage of our referral program.</p>

<h3>How do I unsubscribe from occasional newsletters?</h3>
<p>To unsubscribe from daily sales emails, please click <a href="unsubscribe.html">here</a> and enter your email address in the box before clicking the unsubscribe button. Unsubscribing will not deactivate your account it will just remove you from our mailing list and you can contact us if you wish to re-subscribe.</p>
